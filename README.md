The system intelligently filters out gear that is already reserved during the chosen period, preventing booking conflicts. Users can add multiple items to a cart and submit a single reservation for all selected gear, enhancing usability and efficiency.

**Key Features:**

* Real-time gear availability filtering
* Automatic prevention of overlapping reservations
* Cart-based multi-item reservations
* Gear inventory management with category-based filtering
* API integration for secure authentication and authorization (production use)
